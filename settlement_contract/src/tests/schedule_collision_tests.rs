//! Regression coverage for issue #570: the `ScheduledOperation` storage key
//! is `sha256(operation.to_xdr())`. A real SHA-256 collision can't be
//! manufactured in a test, so these tests simulate one by writing a
//! `ScheduledOp` directly into the exact storage slot a *different*
//! operation would use, then confirm `schedule`/`execute`/`cancel` detect
//! the mismatch instead of silently treating the hash match as proof the
//! stored data belongs to the operation in hand.
